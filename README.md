# NGG_Video
The NGG is a great tool for showing images but if someone wants to show images and videos he do not have a chance to make that. This extension should change that.

## How to use
- Install the plugin as every other plugin in wordpress. 
- After the installation you will find the page "NGG Video" under the "Settings" in the admin panel.
- There you can select a wordpress gallery and click on Select.
- Now you can define a video url for every image.
- Click on Save.
- Go to the location where you want your video gallery.
- Use the following shortcode to add a gallery as video gallery:
```php
[nggallery id=YOUR_GALLERY_ID template="nggvideo"] 
```
- Save the page and enjoy your video gallery
